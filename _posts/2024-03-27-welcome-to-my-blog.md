&emsp;Welcome to my blog, where I post about things I learn from courses or my own study. The topics range from applied mathematics to finance to hardware design. To view posts by category, you can click the [Category](/categories) tab. I will also include any notable projects that I've worked on and detail their utilities and features, as well as publications (currently have none, but hope to have many in the future).

&emsp;The motivation for writing this blog is to hold myself accountable for learning and retaining information that will be important for my career endeavors. In the past, I went into courses with the goal of just scraping by with acceptable grades and not actually spending the time to enrich my understanding of fundamental concepts in the subjects that I'm supposed to be proficient in: data structures and algorithms, probability and statistics, signal processing, etc. In short, with this blog I am trying to undo my past mistakes and gain more knowledge with every passing day, taking advantage of all the resources I have been graciously provided.
